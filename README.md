# xkom-hot-shot-notificator
Hey that's my 1st project of that kind!
If somehow you want to make it work you will need python3 and some libs:

-win10toast (with latest pull https://github.com/Charnelx/Windows-10-Toast-Notifications for callback on click) (ToastNotifier)

-requests

-lxml (html)

-webbrowser

-apscheduler.schedulers.blocking (BlockingScheduler)

You can easily configure it in windows task scheduler to add this into your PC routine 

Have fun while using it :)
